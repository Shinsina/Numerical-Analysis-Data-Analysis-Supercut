This repository/folder contains the "best of" or supercut of my Numerical Analysis (Data Analysis) 1 Class. The file
names (or comments contained within the code of the .ipynb files) should be enough explanation as to what the code does.
PDF files found in this folder are to be associated with files of a similar name (Such as FA2019_HW9.pdf is to be
associated with HW 9.ipynb). File names that seem similar are more than likely related and should be analyzed/opened
as such. All files are as they were turned in for the class and additional documentation will be added as necessary. 
This has been my favorite class throughout my university career and I am working on improving my Data Analysis skills 
with learning more languages and more ways to work with data in a variety of fashions. Which is shown in other repositories/projects here.
